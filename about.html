    <h2>History:</h2>
    <p>Pizza Hut was launched on May 31, 1958,[6] by two brothers, Dan and Frank Carney, both Wichita State students, as a single location in Wichita, Kansas.[7] Six months later they opened a second outlet, and within a year they were operating six locations.[8]

        One early employee was future Pro Football Hall of Fame head coach Bill Parcells, who had worked for the company while a college student and football player at Wichita State University. Parcells was considering a franchise for a career (as well as law school), but instead chose to enter coaching, eventually becoming a head coach in the National Football League.[9]</p>
